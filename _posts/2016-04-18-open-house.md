Skypoint Farm partnered with the [Kent State IHSA Hunt Seat Team](https://www.kentstateihsa.com/) for their first-ever Open House. Including about 15 interested students, most of the current team, and various family members, about 40 people visited the farm that day. Despite a high of 30 degrees during the event, our visitors braved the cold and enjoyed a day at the farm. Prospective riders toured the barn, learned about the team, and talked to current team members about their experience. About half of them also chose to take an evaluation ride during the Open House. Since the team doesnâ€™t have try-outs at this point, an evaluation ride is necessary for the coaches to get a feel for the skill levels of new riders.
