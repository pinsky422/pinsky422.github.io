This is a test post to remind ourselves how to properly format everything.  All posts need a `post.img` (dimensions: ANY), and a `post.thumbnail` (dimensions: 400x290 px).  The post title must have the current date in its title, and use the correct formatting: `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md`.  As discussed in the Jekyll Docs, all posts are Markdown files with "front matter" headers like the one at the top of this file.  Images need to live in the `/img/portfolio` folder, although we can rename that folder if needed, we'll just need to tweak the code a little.  Currently, the home page limits the number of posts (Stories) shown to 6, meaning the older posts won't be shown, but that can be changed in `_includes/portfolio_grid.html`. Each of these posts also needs an incremental `modal-id` number, to distinguish it from the other modal popups on the page.  This might also be something we can tweak.
